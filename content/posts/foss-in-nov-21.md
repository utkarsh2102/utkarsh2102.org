Here's my (twenty-sixth) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 35th month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

Just churning through the backlog again this month. Ugh.

Anyway, I did the following stuff in Debian:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:6.1.4.1+dfsg-3) - No-change rebuild for unstable.

#### Other $things:

- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 10th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I've joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

I mostly worked on different things, I guess.

I was too lazy to maintain a list of things I worked on so there's
no concrete list atm. Maybe I'll get back to this section later or
will start to list stuff from next year onward, as I was doing before. :D

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my twenty-sixth month as a Debian LTS and seventeenth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 30.00 hours for LTS and 45.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  

#### LTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:


#### ELTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:


#### Other (E)LTS Work:

- Front-desk duty from 29-11 to 05-12 for both LTS and ELTS.
- Triaged [rpm](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rpm),
[python3.4](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python3.4), and
[openssh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openssh).
- Auto EOL'ed linux for jessie.
- Attended monthly Debian LTS meeting.
- Answered questions (& discussions) on IRC (#debian-lts and #debian-elts).
- General and other discussions on LTS private and [public mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2021/11/threads.html).

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
