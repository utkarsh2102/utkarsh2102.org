Hey,

(DPL Style):  
TL;DR: I joined Debian LTS as a trainee in July (during DebConf) and finally as
a paid contributor from this month onward! :D  

---

Here's something interesting that happened last weekend!  
Back during the good days of DebConf19, I finally got a chance to meet Holger!
As amazing and inspiring a person he is, it was an absolute pleasure meeting
him and also, I got a chance to talk about Debian LTS in more detail.  

I was introduced to Debian LTS by Abhijith during his talk in MiniDebConf Delhi.
And since then, I've been kinda interested in that project.  
But finally it was here that things got a little "official" and after a couple
of mail exchanges with Holger and Raphael, I joined in as a trainee!  

I had almost no idea what to do next, so the next month I stayed silent,
observing the workflow as people kept committing, uploading, and announcing updates.  
And finally in September, I started triaging and fixing the CVEs for Jessie
and Stretch (mostly the former).  

Thanks to Abhijith who explained the basics of what DLA is and how do we go
about fixing bugs and then announcing them.  

With that, I could fix a couple of CVEs and thanks to Holger (again) for
reviewing and sponsoring the uploads!  

I mostly worked (as a trainee) on:  
- CVE-2019-10751, affecting `httpie`, and  
- CVE-2019-16680, affecting `file-roller`.  

And finally this happened:

So finally, I'll be working with the team from this month on!  
As Holger says, "very much yay"! \o/


Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
