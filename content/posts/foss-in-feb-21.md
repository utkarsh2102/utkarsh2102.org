Here's my (seventeenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 26th month of active contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

This month was a nice mix of amusement, excitement, nervousness, and craziness. More on it below.  
Anyway, whilst I was super-insanely busy this month, I still did some Debian stuff here and there. Here are the following things I worked on:

## Interesting Bits!

- Last month, I wrote:

  > Besides, there's something more that is in the pipelines. Can't talk about it now, shh. But
  > hopefully very sooooooon!

  And now I *can* talk about it! So here it is..  
  I've joined Canonical as a SDE to work on Ubuntu, full time!!! \o/  
  Fully remote + dream job/work + most of the work is in the open-source domain + the **beessstttt** co-workers one could ever ask for! üíñ  

  It's been an amazing time so far and I'll talk more about it later this month.  
  But for now, here's our *team monitor selfie*‚Ñ¢ (with Rick missing because of his "secret plan"! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  
  ![](/images/server-team-meeting.png#center)  
  *We'll soon e-meet them in a more detailed manner in the next blog post, that is, later this month!*

- In another exciting news, I got 2 more CVEs assigned!!! \o/  
  No, it is not something that I found, it was discovered by Tavis Ormandy. I just assigned
  them a CVE ID, [CVE-2021-26937](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26937)
  for screen and [CVE-2021-27135](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27135) for xterm.  
  This is my 2nd and 3rd, so I am (still) very excited about this! ^_^

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my sixteenth month as a Debian LTS and eighth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 60.00 hours for LTS and 60.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  
(however, I had overworked for 9 hours for both, LTS and ELTS, last month so I had to work for 51 hours for both this month!)
