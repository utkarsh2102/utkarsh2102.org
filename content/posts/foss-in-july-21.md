Here's my (twenty-second) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 31st month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

I spent most of my free time on Clubhouse but still did everything I usually do (but did not go much beyond that, really).

Anyway, I did the following stuff in Debian:
