Here's my (twenty-second) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 31st month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

I spent most of my free time on Clubhouse but still did everything I usually do (but did not go much beyond that, really).

Anyway, I did the following stuff in Debian:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [libjdom1-java](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libjdom1-java) (1.1.3-2.1) - Fix for [CVE-2021-33813](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33813)/[#990672](https://bugs.debian.org/990672).
- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:6.0.3.7+dfsg-2) - Relax dependecny on ruby-marcel for Bullseye migration.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 6th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I've joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

I mostly worked on different things, I guess. But mostly on packaging [keylime](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/python-keylime) and some Google Agents upload(s) and SRU(s). Also did a lot of reviewing, et al.

I was too lazy to maintain a list of things I worked on so there's no concrete list atm. Maybe I'll get back to this section later or will start to list stuff from next month onward, as I've been doing before. :D

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
