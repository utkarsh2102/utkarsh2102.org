I started contributing to open source around a year back and on 1st January
2019 to Debian, specifically (wasn't really a new year resolution, though :P).  
I'll be honest here. The reason behind taking the "Debian road" was solely to
distract myself from the mental abuse I was going through.  

[Raju](https://nm.debian.org/person/rajudev) was the person who started helping me out,
both, personally and professionally. He's the one who taught me packaging from
scratch with utmost patience and kept answering all my stupid doubts :D  
To be honest, if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have been here, at this
position today.

Since I wanted to distract myself from various stuff, I learned things quickly and
kept working, *consistently*.  
I turned up on IRC every single day since then.
[Praveen](https://nm.debian.org/person/praveen) became both, my guru and my package
sponsorer. He kept uploading and I kept packaging. This went on for a month
until my difficulty level was bumped. From basic Ruby gems and Node libraries, I
was given gems and modules that had test failures to debug and had a weirdly
different build system. This made me uncomfortable. I complained. To which,
Praveen said and I quote,  
> "If you want to keep working on simple stuff, then it's not going to help you 
move forward. And it's your loss. No one else would care. So it's your call."`  

There was probably no option there, isn't it? :P  
I took it on. Struggled for a few days but it became normal and I made it
through. Like they say, "it gets better", it indeed did!  
I took a little more challenging things, understood more concepts. Fixed test
failures, RC bugs and learned a lot of things (still a lot, lot more to learn,
though) in the process, like understanding about the Debian release cycle, how
the migration of package takes place, setting up my own repositories, et al.  

In this process, I also met another JS guru, [Xavier](https://nm.debian.org/person/yadd).  
He did not only corrected my mistakes and sponsored my packages, but also helped me
in actually understanding a lot of things. From the mailing list, we started
conversing over private mail threads and soon, in a span of 3 months, the thread
stretched over to 300 mails! :x  

In early March, I was told that I could apply for the position of the
Debian Maintainer, if only I understood the process of when to upload a package
to experimental and when to unstable. I was given a few packages as a test by
Praveen for the same.  
And "luckily", I passed. This meant that the only part remaining was to fulfil
the initial keysigning requirement. For which, there was a MiniDebConf, Delhi
around the corner.  

As it happened, Praveen, Abhijith, and Sruthi (all DDs) came to the MiniDebConf from
Kerala and I got my keys signed by them! :D  
Soon after, I applied for becoming a DM.  

I was lucky enough to get 3 advocates, Praveen, Xavier, and Abhijith.  
Here's my [NM Process (#605)](https://nm.debian.org/process/605) for reference.  
And in a few days, I realized that I became the youngest Debian Maintainer in
India \o/  
> Edit: I was later told at DC19 that I was the youngest DM in the entire commmunity! :o


Lastly, I thank myself for being consistent, for turning up no matter what, and for
not giving up!  
Also, much thanks to [Sanyam](https://twitter.com/ErSanyamKhurana). He really
kept me going. Also to [Cocoa](https://twitter.com/CocoaThePenguin) and 
[Sakshi](https://twitter.com/sakshisangwan04).  

Lastly, thanks to the entire Debian community. Debian has really been an amazing
journey, an amazing place, and an amazing family.  
I am just hoping to make it to DebConf and meet all the people I adore \o/  


Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
