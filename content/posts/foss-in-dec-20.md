Here's my (fifteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 24th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

Amongs a lot of things, this was month was crazy, hectic, adventerous, and the last of 2020 -- more on some parts later this month.  
I finally finished my 7th semester (FTW!) and moved onto my last one! That said, I had been busy with other thingsâ„¢ but still did a bunch of Debian stuff

Here are the following things I did this month:

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my fifteenth month as a Debian LTS and sixth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 26.00 hours for LTS and 38.25 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:

#### Misc and Fun

Besides squashing bugs and submitting patches, I did some other things as well!

- Participated in my first [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event! :)  
  Whilst it was indeed fun, I didn't really complete it. No reason, really. But I'll definitely come back stronger next year, heh! :)  
  All the solutions thus far could be found [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/AdventOfCode/).
- Did a couple of reviews for some PRs and triaged some bugs here and there, meh.
- Also did some cloud debugging, not so fun if you ask me, but cool enough to make me want to do it again! ^_^
- Worked along with pollo, zigo, ehashman, rlb, et al for puppet and puppetserver in Debian. OMG, they're so lovely! <3
- Ordered some interesting books to read January onward. New year resolution? Meh, not really. Or maybe. But nah.
- Also did some interesting stuff this month but can't really talk about it now. Hopefully sooooon.

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
