Here's my (twentieth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 29th month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

Interesting month, surprisingly. Lots of things happening and lots of moving parts; becoming the "new normal", I believe.
Anyhow, working on Ubuntu full-time has its own advantage and one of them is being able to work on Debian stuff! ü•∞

So whilst I couldn't upload a lot of packages because of the freeze, here's what I worked on:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [ruby-rack-cors](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rack-cors) (1.0.2-1+deb10u1) - Fix for [CVE-2019-18978](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18978)/[#944849](https://bugs.debian.org/944849).

- Sponsored upload of [htmldoc](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/htmldoc) (1.9.3-1+deb10u1) to [buster-pu](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1241189/accepted-htmldoc-193-1deb10u1-source-all-amd64-into-proposed-updates-stable-new-proposed-updates/), fixing [CVE-2019-19630](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19630) and [CVE-2021-20308](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20308) for H√•vard Flaget Aasen.
- Sponsored upload of [libbusiness-us-usps-webtools-perl](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libbusiness-us-usps-webtools-perl) (1.125-1) to [unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1241495/accepted-libbusiness-us-usps-webtools-perl-1125-1-source-into-unstable/), fixing [#988330](https://bugs.debian.org/988330) for Yadd.
- Sponsored upload of [radsecproxy](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/radsecproxy) (1.8.2-4) to [unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1241891/accepted-radsecproxy-182-4-source-into-unstable/), fixing [CVE-2021-32642](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-32642) for Sven Hartge.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 4th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I've joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

This month, by all means, was dedicated mostly to PHP 8.0, transitioning from PHP 7.4 to 8.0.
Naturally, it had so many moving parts and moments of utmost frustration, shared w/ Bryce. :D

So even though I can't upload anything, I worked on the following stuff & asked for sponsorship.  
But before, I'd like to take a moment to stress how kind and awesome [Gianfranco Costamagna](https://launchpad.net/~costamagnagianfranco),
a.k.a. [LocutusOfBorg](https://nm.debian.org/person/locutusofborg) is! He's been sponsoring a
bunch of my things & helping with re-triggers, et al. Thanks a bunch, Gianfranco; beers on me
whenever we meet! üçª

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my twentieth month as a Debian LTS and eleventh month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 29.75 hours for LTS and 40.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:
