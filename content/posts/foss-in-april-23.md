Here's my (forty-third) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 52nd month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

There's a bunch of things I do, both, technical and non-technical. Here are the things I did this month:

- Moderation of -project mailing list.
- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Reviewing packages from other fellow contributors.
- Some tiny bits of DebConf Bursary team work, attending meetings, et al.

A huge thanks to Freexian for sponsoring my Debian work.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 27th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.org/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

I mostly worked on different things, I guess.

I was too lazy to maintain a list of things I worked on so there's
no concrete list atm. Maybe I'll get back to this section later or
will start to list stuff from the fall, as I was doing before. :D

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the stretch and jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my forty-third month as a Debian LTS and thirty-fourth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I worked for 3.5 hours for LTS and 0 hours for ELTS.

#### LTS Work:

- Helped Scarlett with their uploads and with general questions.
- Some work and progress on ruby-rails-html-sanitizer.
- LTS package claim traiges.

#### Other (E)LTS Work:

- Triaged [ruby-loofah](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-loofah) and
[ruby-rails-html-sanitizer](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rails-html-sanitizer).
- Helped and assisted fellow Freexian contributors (LTS/ELTS/internally).
- Answered questions (& discussions) on IRC (#debian-lts and #debian-elts) and Matrix.
- Participated and helped fellow members with their queries via private mail and chat.
- General and other discussions on LTS private and [public mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2023/04/threads.html).
- Attended the monthly LTS meeting.

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
