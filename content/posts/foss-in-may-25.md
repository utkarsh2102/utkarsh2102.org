Here's my 68th monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 77th month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

This month I've just been sort of MIA, mostly because of a combination of the Canonical engineering sprints in Frankfurt, a bit of vacation in Italy, and then being sick. So didn't really get much done in Debian this month.

## Ubuntu

This was my 53rd month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
I joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.org/posts/hello-canonical/) back in February 2021.

Whilst I can't give a full, detailed list of things I did (there's so much and some of it might not be public...yet!), here's a quick TL;DR of what I did:

- Prepared for the engineering sprints in Frankfurt.
- Delivered the Ubuntu knowledge sharing session during the sprints.
- Released the first monthly snapshot of Ubuntu 25.10.
  - Ref: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/supercharging-ubuntu-releases-monthly-snapshots-automation/61876
  - Release: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/questing-snapshot-1-released/61889
- Archived the Focal release as it goes in the hands of the ESM team now.
  - Announcement: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/extended-security-maintenance-for-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-began-on-may-29-2025/61909
- Got a recognition award for driving the Plucky Puffin release, nominated by Florent. \o/

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the buster, stretch, and jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my 68th month as a Debian LTS and 55th month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
Due to a combination of the Canonical engineering sprints in Frankfurt, a bit of vacation in Italy, and then being sick, I was barely able to do (E)LTS work. So this month, I worked for only 1.00 hours for LTS and 0 hours for ELTS.

I did the following things:

- [LTS] Attended the hourly LTS meeting on IRC. [Summary here](https://meetbot.debian.net/debian-lts/2025/debian-lts.2025-05-22-14.00.html).

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
