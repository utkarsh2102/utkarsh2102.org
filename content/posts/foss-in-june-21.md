Here's my (twenty-first) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 30th month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

However, this wasn't  really a good month for mental health. And so apparently lesser work but still more than nothing, heh. :D

As a side note, this month, I spent a lot of time on Clubhouse, the new social auido app, at least in India. (I am sure you'd have heard?) Anyway, I made some friends there; more on that later, maybe? (ik, I say that a lot, but ugh, I'll get to it!)

Anyway, I did the following stuff in Debian:


#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:5.2.2.1+dfsg-1+deb10u3) - Fix for [CVE-2021-22885](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22904)/[#988214](https://bugs.debian.org/988214), [CVE-2021-22904](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22904)/[#988214](https://bugs.debian.org/988214), and [CVE-2021-22880](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22880).
- [eterm](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/eterm) (0.9.6-6.1) - Fix [CVE-2021-33477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33477)/[#989041](https://bugs.debian.org/989041) for Debian unstable, a.k.a. sid.
- [eterm](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/eterm) (0.9.6-5+deb10u1) - Fix [CVE-2021-33477](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33477)/[#989041](https://bugs.debian.org/989041) for Debian 10, buster.
- [micro](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/micro) (2.0.9-1) - New upstream version, v2.0.9.
- [ruby-httpclient](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-httpclient) (2.8.3-3) - Disable tests related to `HTTP_PROXY` as Launchpad builders don't like them.

#### Other $things:

- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 5th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I've joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

This month, again, was dedicated to PHP 8.0, transitioning from PHP 7.4 to 8.0.
And finally, me and Bryce were able to complete the transition! \o/

This month, I also became an Ubuntu Core Developer. :D
I'll write about it in sometime; lol, yet another promise. Heh.

---

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
