## Debian

It's been 14 months since I've started contributing to Debian.
And 4 months since I've been a Debian Developer. And in this beautiful time,

## Ruby2.7 Migration:
{{< figure src="/images/ruby-logo-small.png" >}}

Ruby2.7 was recently released on 25th December, 2019. Santa's gift. Believe it or not.
We, the Debian Ruby team, have been trying hard to make it migrate to testing. And it finally happened.
The default version in testing is ruby2.7. Here's the [news](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1119524/ruby-defaults-1271-migrated-to-testing/)! \o/  
Here's what I worked on this month for this transition.

## Debian LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases
to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group
of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  
This was my seventh month as a Debian LTS paid contributor. I was assigned 24.00 hours and worked on
the following things:

## Other(s)
{{< figure src="/images/vendetta.jpg" >}}

Sometimes it gets hard to categorize work/things into a particular category.  
That's why I am writing all of those things inside this category.  
This includes two sub-categories and they are as follows.

#### Personal:

This month I could get the following things done:

- Most importantly, I finally migrated to a new website. Huge UI imporvement! \o/  
  From Jekyll to Hugo, it was not easy. But it was worth it! Many thanks to [Luiz](https://luizdepra.dev/) for writing [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/), [Clement](https://clementpannetier.dev/), and [Samyak](https://samyak-jn.tk/)! ðŸ”¥  
  If you find any flaws, issues and pull requests are welcomed at [utkarsh2102/utkarsh2102.org](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utkarsh2102.org)  
- Wrote [battery-alert](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utsh/blob/master/battery-alert.sh), a mini-project of my own to show battery alerts at <10% and >90%.  
  Written in shell, it brings me all the satisfaction as it has saved my life on many occasions.  
  And guess what? It has more users than just myself! ðŸ˜‰  
  Reviews and patches are welcomed \o/  
- Mentored in [HackOn Hackathon](https://twitter.com/HackOnHackathon/status/1249582939261693953). Thanks to [Manvi](https://twitter.com/manvisinghwal) for reaching out! ðŸ¤—  
  It was fun to see people developing some really nice projects.
- Thanks to [Ray](https://twitter.com/rspaik) and [John](https://twitter.com/john_cogs), I became a [GitLab Hero](https://about.gitlab.com/community/heroes/members/)! ðŸ¥³  
  (I am yet to figure out my role and responibility though)  
- Atteneded [Intro Sec Con](https://twitter.com/introseccon) and had the most fun!  
  Heard Ian's keynote and attended other talks and learned how to use WireShark! ðŸ¦ˆ  

#### Open Source:

Again, this contains all the things that I couldn't categorize earlier.  
Opened several issues and pull requests:

- [Issue #297](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/issues/297) against `hugo-coder`, asking to enable RSS feed for blogs.  
- [PR #316](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/pull/316) for `hugo-coder` for fixing the above issue myself.  
- [Issue #173](https://github.com/activeadmin/arbre/issues/173) against `arbre` for requesting a release.  
- [Issue #104](https://github.com/pat/combustion/issues/104) against `combustion`, asking to relax dependency on rubocop. Fixed in this [commit](https://github.com/pat/combustion/commit/902df3252f9ae38a0f127b4ae086e0da4944b80f).  
- [Issue #16](https://github.com/ffi/ffi-compiler/issues/16) against `ffi-compiler` for requesting to fix homepage and license.  
- [Issue #57](https://github.com/awalterschulze/gographviz/issues/57) against `gographviz` for requesting a release.  
- [Issue #14](https://github.com/cboursnell/crb-blast/issues/14) against `crb-blast`, suggesting compatability with bio 2.0.x.  
- [Issue #58](https://github.com/flyerhzm/uniform_notifier/issues/58) against `uniform_notifier` for asking to drop the use of ruby-growl.  
- [PR #2072](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2072) for `polybar`, adding installation instructions on Debian systems.

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
