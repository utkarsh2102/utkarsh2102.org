Here's my (thirty-fourth) monthly but brief update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 43rd month of actively contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March 2019 and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) on Christmas '19! \o/

There's a bunch of things I did this month but mostly non-technical, now that DC22 is around the corner. Here are the things I did:

- Doing DebConf stuff! \o/
  - Some DebConf talks, some assists, et al.
  - Talking about Freexian/LTS with fellow attendees.
- Volunteering for DC22 Content team.
- Leading the Bursary team w/ Paulo.
- Answering a bunch of questions and things bursary.
- Being an AM for [Arun Kumar, process #1024](https://nm.debian.org/process/1024/).
- Mentoring for newcomers.
- Moderation of -project mailing list.

## Ubuntu
{{< figure src="/images/ubuntu-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 18th month of actively contributing to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/about).
Now that I joined [Canonical to work on Ubuntu full-time](https://utkarsh2102.org/posts/hello-canonical/), there's a bunch of things I do! \o/

I mostly worked on different things, I guess.

I was too lazy to maintain a list of things I worked on so there's
no concrete list atm. Maybe I'll get back to this section later or
will start to list stuff from the fall, as I was doing before. :D

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my thirty-fourth month as a Debian LTS and twenty-fifth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I worked for 1.00 hours for LTS and 0.00 hours for ELTS, thanks to DebConf. :P

#### LTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:

- Helped Andrea, the mbedtls maintainer, (and Samuel) understand the security tracker interals.  
  Also helped them in doing precise triages, fix the incorrect ones, and deep-dived into remaining LTS ones.

#### ELTS CVE Fixes and Announcements:

- Did absolutely nothing. :)

#### Other Freexian internal work:

- Triaged [mbedtls](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mbedtls).
- Moar reading on the documentation bits.
- Answered questions (& discussions) on IRC (#debian-lts and #debian-elts).
- Co-presented LTS BoF with Anton Gladky. Showed the survey results.
- Talked to upstream CIP kernel folks to help Freexian's internal goals and bribed them w beers. :)
- Had a chat around Freexian, LTS, and ELTS with other conference attendees.
- Answered questions (& discussions) on IRC (#debian-lts and #debian-elts).
- Participated and helped fellow members with their queries via private mail and chat.
- General and other discussions on LTS private and [public mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2022/07/threads.html).

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
