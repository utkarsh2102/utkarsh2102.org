Here's my (thirteenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 22nd month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/

Whilst busy with my undergrad, I could still take some time out for contributing to Debian (I always do!).
Here are the following things I did in Debian this month:

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

[Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And [Debian Extended LTS (ELTS)](https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my thirteenth month as a Debian LTS and fourth month as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 20.75 hours for LTS and 30.00 hours for ELTS and worked on the following things:  
(for ELTS, I worked for 5.25 hours extra, so my total hours this month for ELTS were 35.25!)
