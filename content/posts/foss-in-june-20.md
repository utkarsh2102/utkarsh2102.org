Here's my (ninth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 16th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/  

This month was a little intense. I did a lot of different kinds of things in Debian this month. Whilst most of my time went on doing security stuff, I also sponsored a bunch of packages.

Here are the following things I did this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:5.2.4.3+dfsg-1) - fix a bunch of [CVEs](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/rails) in Sid and Bullseye.  
- [ruby-json](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-json) (2.1.0+dfsg-2+deb10u1) - backport [CVE-2020-10663](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10663) fix to Buster.

## GSoC Phase 1, Part 2!
![](/images/debian_ruby.png#center)

Last month, I got selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) again! \o/  
I am working on the [Upstream-Downstream Cooperation in Ruby](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects/#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FUpstreamDownstreamCooperationInRuby.Upstream.2FDownstream_cooperation_in_Ruby) project.

The first half of the first month is blogged here, titled, [GSoC Phase 1](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-1/).  
Also, I log daily updates at [gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/).

Whilst the daily updates are available at the above site^, Iâ€™ll breakdown the important parts of the later half of the first month here:

- Documented the first cop, `GemspecGit` via [PR #2](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/2).
- Made an initial release, [v0.1.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop-packaging)! ðŸ’–
- Spread the word/usage about this tool/library via adding them in the official [RuboCop docs](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/extensions.html).
- We had our [third weekly meeting](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/log/2020/06/18/day18.html) where we discussed the next steps and the things that are supposed to be done for the next set of cops.
- Wrote more tests so as to cover different aspects of the `GemspecGit` cop.
- Opened [PR #4](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/4/) for the next Cop, `RequireRelativeToLib`.
- Introduced [rubocop-packaging](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging) to the outer world and requested other upstream projects to use it! It is being used by 6 other projects already ðŸ˜­ðŸ’–
- Had our [fourth weekly meeting](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/log/2020/06/25/day25.html) where we pair-programmed (and I sucked :P) and figured out a way to make the second cop work.
- Found a bug, reported at [issue #5](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/5) and raised [PR #6](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/6) to fix it.
- And finally, people loved the library/tool (and it's outcome):  
![](/images/bbatsov-comment.png#center)  
![](/images/lienvdsteen-comment.png#center)  
![](/images/pboling-comment.png#center)  
(for those who don't know, [@bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov) is the author of [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/), [@lienvdsteen](https://gitlab.com/lienvdsteen) is an amazing fullstack engineer at GitLab, and [@pboling](https://github.com/pboling) is the author of some awesome Ruby tools and libraries!)

## Continuation of GSoC for other Ruby related stuff!
{{< figure src="/images/ruby-logo-small.png" >}}

Whilst I have already mentioned it multiple times but it's still not enough to stress how amazing [Antonio Terceiro](https://github.com/terceiro) and [David RodrÃ­guez](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/) are! ðŸ’–  
They're more than just mentors to me!

Well, only they know how much I trouble them with different things, which are not only related to my GSoC project but also extends to the projects they maintain! :P  
David maintains [rubygems and bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/) and Antonio maintains [debci](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci).

So on days when I decide to hack on `rubygems` or `debci`, only I know how kind and nice David and Anotonio are to me!  
They very patiently walk me through with whatever I am stuck on, no matter what and no matter when.

Thus, with them around, I contributed to these two projects and more, with regards to working on `rubocop-packaging`.  
Following are a few things that I raised:

- [PR #3731](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3731) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to ship default `.rubocop.yml` file.
- [PR #2140](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/2140) for [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) to fix `bundler_spec` test.
- [PR #3740](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3740) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to fix all RuboCop offenses.
- [MR #114](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci/-/merge_requests/114) for [debci](https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debci) to show package details on the retry page.
- [Issue #356](https://github.com/ruby/rake/issues/356) against [rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) to request to support all `gitignore` rule patterns in `rake/file_list`.
- [PR #9](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore/pull/9) for [fast_ignore](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore) to use `fast_ignore` instead of `git ls-files`.
- [PR #3748](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3748) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to add actions to automatically bump man page month.
- [PR #8160](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8160) for [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) to add `rubocop-packaging` as a known extension.
- [PR #3754](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3754) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to constrain the shipped RuboCop's version.
- [Issue #8](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore/issues/8) against [fast_ignore](https://github.com/robotdana/fast_ignore) to clarify the strange behavior of `include_files`.
- [PR #3765](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3765) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to fix remaining RuboCop issues and add tests.

## Debian LTS

## Other(s)
{{< figure src="/images/computing.jpg" >}}

Sometimes it gets hard to categorize work/things into a particular category.  
That's why I am writing all of those things inside this category.  
This includes two sub-categories and they are as follows.

#### Personal:

This month I did the following things:

- Wrote and published v0.1.0 of `rubocop-packaging` on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop-packaging)! ðŸ’¯  
  It's open-sourced and the repository is [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging).  
  Bug reports and pull requests are welcomed! ðŸ˜‰
- Integrated a tiny (yet a powerful) hack to align images in markdown for my blog.  
  Commit [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/hugo-coder/commit/646aed40da8d508dbeaa8d8698b65212574a136a). ðŸš€
- Released v0.4.0 of `batalert` on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/batalert)! ðŸ¤—

Thank you for sticking along for so long :)  

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
