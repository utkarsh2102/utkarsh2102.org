Here's my (tenth) monthly update about the activities I've done in the F/L/OSS world.

## Debian
{{< figure src="/images/debian-logo-small.png" >}}

This was my 17th month of contributing to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
I became a [DM](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer) in late March last year and a [DD](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper) last Christmas! \o/  

Well, this month I didn't do a lot of Debian stuff, like I usually do, however, I did a lot of things related to Debian (indirectly via GSoC)!

Anyway, here are the following things I did this month:

#### Uploads and bug fixes:

- [rails](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rails) (2:6.0.3.2+dfsg-1) - Fix [CVE-2020-8185](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-8185) (Closes [#964081](https://bugs.debian.org/964081)).  
- [ruby-rubocop-packaging](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-rubocop-packaging) (0.1.1-1) - Fix blank file [issue](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/5).

## GSoC Phase 2, Part 2!
![](/images/debian_ruby.png#center)

In May, I got selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) again! \o/  
I am working on the [Upstream-Downstream Cooperation in Ruby](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2020/Projects/#SummerOfCode2020.2FApprovedProjects.2FUpstreamDownstreamCooperationInRuby.Upstream.2FDownstream_cooperation_in_Ruby) project.

The first three blogs can be found here:
- [GSoC Phase 1 (part 1)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-1/).
- [GSoC Phase 1 (part 2)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/foss-in-june-20/).
- [GSoC Phase 2 (part 1)](https://utkarsh2102.com/posts/gsoc-phase-2/).
- And this is GSoC Phase 2 (part 2).

Also, I log daily updates at [gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk](https://gsocwithutkarsh2102.tk/).

Whilst the daily updates are available at the above site^, Iâ€™ll breakdown the important parts of the later half of the second month here:

- [Marc Andre](https://github.com/marcandre), very kindly, helped in [fixing the specs](https://github.com/marcandre/rubocop-packaging/commit/90d23d16dff4fd00652d3e5c7f32c88d9c987225) that were failing earlier this month. Well, the problem was with the specs, but I am still confused how so. Anyway..
- Finished documentation of the second cop and marked the PR as ready to be reviewed.
- David reviewed and suggested some really good changes and I fixed/tweaked that PR as per his suggestion to finally finish the last bits of the second cop, `RelativeRequireToLib`.
- Merged the PR upon two approvals and released it as v0.2.0! ðŸ’–
- We had our next weekly meeting where we discussed the next steps and the things that are supposed to be done for the next set of cops.
- Introduced [rubocop-packaging](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging) to the outer world and requested other upstream projects to use it! It is being used by [13 other projects](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMjY1ODQyMzQ1) already! ðŸ˜­ðŸ’–
- Started to work on [packaging-style-guide](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/packaging-style-guide) but I didn't push anything to the public repository yet.
- Worked on refactoring the `cops_documentation` Rake task which was broken by the new auto-corrector API. Opened [PR #7](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/pull/7) for it. It'll be merged after the next RuboCop release as it uses `CopsDocumentationGenerator` class from the master branch.
- Whilst working on [autoprefixer-rails](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails), I found something unusual. The second cop shouldn't really report offenses if the `require_relative` calls are from `lib` to `lib` itself. This is a false-positive. Opened [issue #8](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging/issues/8) for the same.

---

## Continuation of GSoC for other Ruby related stuff!
{{< figure src="/images/ruby-logo-small.png" >}}

Whilst working on `rubocop-packaging`, I contributed to more Ruby projects, refactoring their library a little bit and mostly fixing RuboCop issues and fixing issues that the `Packaging` extension reports as "offensive".  
Following are the PRs that I raised:

## Debian (E)LTS
{{< figure src="/images/debian-lts-small.png" >}}

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.  

And Debian Extended LTS (ELTS) is its sister project, extending support to the Jessie release (+2 years after LTS support).

This was my tenth month as a Debian LTS and my first as a Debian ELTS paid contributor.  
I was assigned 25.25 hours for LTS and 13.25 hours for ELTS and worked on
the following things:

## Other(s)
{{< figure src="/images/computing.jpg" >}}

Sometimes it gets hard to categorize work/things into a particular category.  
That's why I am writing all of those things inside this category.  
This includes two sub-categories and they are as follows.

#### Personal:

This month I did the following things:

- Released v0.2.0 of `rubocop-packaging` on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubocop-packaging)! ðŸ’¯  
  It's open-sourced and the repository is [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/rubocop-packaging).  
  Bug reports and pull requests are welcomed! ðŸ˜‰
- Released v0.1.0 of `get_root` on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/get_root)! ðŸ’–  
  It's open-sourced and the repository is [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/get_root).
- Wrote [max-word-frequency](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/max_word_frequency), my Rails C1M2 programming assignment.  
  And made it pretty neater & cleaner!
- Refactored my `lts-dla` and `elts-ela` scripts entirely and wrote them in Ruby so that there are no issues and no false-positives! ðŸš€  
  Check [lts-dla here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utsh/commit/632ad0c0a6216bb0e5b35fde2a2379a97616dc19) and [elts-ela here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/utsh/commit/614f13183075206596355fe315df0db7a6ec36fa).
- And finally, built my first Rails (mini) web-application! ðŸ¤—  
  The repository is [here](https://github.com/utkarsh2102/recipe_hunter). This was also a programming assignment (C1M3).  
  And furthermore, hosted it at [Heroku](https://recipe-hunter-2102.herokuapp.com/).


#### Open Source:

Again, this contains all the things that I couldn't categorize earlier.  
Opened several issues and PRs:

- [Issue #8273](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues/8273) against [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop), reporting a false-positive auto-correct for `Style/WhileUntilModifier`.
- [Issue #615](https://github.com/httprb/http/issues/615) against [http](https://github.com/httprb/http) reporting a weird behavior of a flaky test.
- [PR #3791](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/3791) for [rubygems/bundler](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) to remove redundant `bundler/setup` require call from `spec_helper` generated by `bundle gem`.
- [Issue #3831](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/3831) against [rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), reporting a traceback of undefined method, `rubyforge_project=`.
- [Issue #238](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/238) against [nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) asking for enhancement in showing the font name in the very font itself.
- [PR #2307](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2307) for [puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) to constrain `rake-compiler` to v0.9.4.
- And finally, I joined the [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber) organization! \o/

Thank you for sticking along for so long :)  

Until next time.  
`:wq` for today.
